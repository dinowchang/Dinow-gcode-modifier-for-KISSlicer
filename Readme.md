# Introduction
The scripts in this project are developed only for gcode generated by [KISSlicer](http://www.kisslicer.com/). To use the scripts in this folder, you should have [Python 3.x ](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
You can run the script in KISSlicer,
> 1. Download the scripts to KISSlicer folder.
> 2. In KISSlicer, switch to `Printer` tab. Then select `Firmware` sub-tab.
> 3. add script command line in `Posr-Process`. ex: `gmod_temp_tower.py -p "<FILE>"`
> ![](./image/post-process.png)
>
> Use & to execute scripts sequentially
> ex: `gmod_heatbed_off.py "<FILE>" 1 & gmod_pause.py -p "<FILE>" 5`
> Turn off heatbed at 1mm height, and pause print at 5mm height.

Or run the script in Command Prompt
> `C:\KISSlicer> gmod_temp_tower.py yourfile.gcode`

# Usage of scripts
## Common arguments
* **input-file**: Input gcode file
* `-p，--pause`: Before scripts end, wait any key to check messages. It's useful when the script is called in KISSlicer.

## Heatbed Off
- Description: Turn off heatbed at specified height
- Usage:
	gmod_heatbed_off.py [-p] input-file height
	* **height**: The height to turn off heatbed

## Pause
- Description: Pause print at specified height
- Usage:
	gmod_pause.py [-p] [-z Z_LIFT] [-x X_LOC] [-y Y_LOC] [-c] [-rl RETRACTION_LENGTH] [-rs RETRACTION_SPEED] input-file height [height ...]
	* **height**: The height list to pause
	* `-z Z_LIFT`: The height to lift before pause, default: 5.0 mm
	* `-x X_LOC`: The x-axis location to park when paused. The head won't move if this value is not set.
	* `-y Y_LOC`: The x-axis location to park when paused. The head won't move if this value is not set.
	* `-rl RETRACTION_LENGTH` : The length to retract before printer is paused, default: 0 mm
	* `-rs RETRACTION_SPEED` : The speed of retraction before printer is paused, default: 0 mm
	* `-c`: Cool down the extruder when printer is paused. The 1st `resume` will warm up extruder then pause again.

## Temperature Tower
- Description: Insert temperature control command for temperature tower test
- Model: [Better Temperature Tower v5 220-180](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2222308)
- Usage:
	gmod_temp_tower.py [-p] [-ho HEIGHT_OFFSET] [-hs HEIGHT_STEP] [-to TEMP_OFFSET] [-ts TEMP_STEP] input-file
	* `-ho HEIGHT_OFFSET`: The height of first test block. Default value is 2.0 mm.
	* `-hs HEIGHT_STEP`: The thickness of each test block. Default value is 7.0 mm.
	* `-to TEMP_OFFSET`: The temperature of first test block. Default value is 220 C.
	* `-ts TEMP_STEP`: The temperature increased for each test block. Default value is -5 C.
	* All default values of arguments are designed for [Better Temperature Tower v5 220-180](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2222308)
